Pokio is an asocial feedback framework? for websites. The idea is that you (the developer) can collect data from your readers, without having to broadcast their opinion. It's personal. It creates a 1-1 relationship between the publisher and the audience. 

You can check out the new branch:

```
$ mkdir pokio
$ git clone https://github.com/dval/pokio.git
```

### Still a concept.
Pokio is still very much in the conceptual stage. Right now, it is just a combination javascript and a php script that logs to a .csv file. But the idea is available. Pokios can be placed as block-level elements next to text or images. They can overlay images in a watermark style. They can be place inline with text, to mark key points or ideas. The idea is that, the more interesting an item is, the more people interact with it.
